# Vampire Hunter GB (a bad shmup)

This is not a serious project, the code IS SLOPPY, the gameplay IS BAD, but it was a fun nostalgic project to take me back to where I taught myself programming - Gameboy Homebrew circa 2003.

## To play

Simply load up schmup.gb in your favorite GB emulator.

## Compilation

Update - this project no longer is compatible with the original GBDK.
You will need to have GBDK-2020 installed (v 4.0.6).

Run `make` to build the gb file.
You will need to check the makefile and the compile.bat to ensure the paths to GBDK are correct for your environment.
