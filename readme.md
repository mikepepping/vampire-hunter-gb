# GB ENDLESS SHMUP

This is not a serious project, the code IS SLOPPY, the gameplay IS BAD, but it was a fun little project.

## To play

Simply load up schmup.gb in your favourite GB emulator.

## Compilation

Update - this project no longer is compatibale with the original GBDK.
You will need to have GBDK-2020 installed (v 4.0.6).

Run `make` to build the gb file.
You will need to check the makefile and the compile.bat to ensure the paths to gbdk are correct for your environment.
