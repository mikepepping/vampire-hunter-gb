# GB ENDLESS SHMUP

This is not a serious project, the code IS SLOPPY, but it was a fun little project.

## To play

Simply load up schmup.gb in your favourite GB emulator.

## Compilation

You will need to have GBDK installed, this project has only ever been compiled on Ubutnu 16 LTS with gcc.

The original GBDK sourceforge project site still stands also with information on how to install GBDK.
